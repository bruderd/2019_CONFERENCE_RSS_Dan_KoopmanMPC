\section{Model Predictive Control}
\label{sec:mpc}

A system model enables the design of model-based controllers that leverage model predictions to choose suitable control inputs for a given task.
In particular, model-based controllers can anticipate future events, allowing them to optimally choose control inputs over a finite time horizon.
The most popular model-based control design technique is model predictive control (MPC), wherein one optimizes the control input over a finite time horizon, applies that input for a single timestep, and then optimizes again, repeatedly \cite{rawlings2009model}.
Applying MPC to design a controller for linear systems corresponds to solving a convex quadratic program. 

% optimizing the control input over an $N_h$ step planning horizon consists of solving a convex quadratic program.

Importantly, this is also the case during Koopman based MPC control design, wherein one solves the following program at each time instance $k$ of the closed-loop operation:
%% Linear MPC optimization problem
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{u[i] , z[i]}{\text{min}}
& & z[N_h]^{T} G_{N_h} z[N_h] + g_{N_h}^T z[N_h] + \cdots \\
&&& \sum_{i=0}^{N_h - 1} z[i]^T G_i z[i] + u[i]^T H_i u[i] + g_i^T z[i] + h_i^T u[i]\\
& \text{s.t.}
& & z[i+1] = \hat{A} z[i] + \hat{B} u[i] , \quad \forall i \in \{ 0 , \ldots , N_h - 1 \} \\
&&& E_i z[i] + F_i u[i] \leq b_i , \quad \forall i \in \{ 0 , \ldots , N_h - 1\} \\
&&& z[0] = \psi (x[k])
\end{aligned} \label{eq:mpc}
\end{equation}
where $G_i \in \Real^{N \times N}$ and $H_i \in \Real^{m \times m}$ are positive semidefinite matrices and where each time the program is called, the predictions are initialized from the current lifted state $\psi (x[k])$.
The matrices $E_i \in \Real^{c \times N}$ and $F_i \in \Real^{c \times m}$ and the vector $b_i \in \Real^{c}$ define state and input polyhedral constraints where $c$ denotes the number of imposed constraints.
Algorithm \ref{alg:mpc} summarizes the closed-loop operation of this Koopman based MPC controller.

Since this optimization problem is convex, it has a unique globally optimal solution that can efficiently constructed without initialization \cite{boyd2004convex} for models with thousands of states and inputs  \cite{paulson2014fast,stellato2018osqp}.
This contrasts sharply with the MPC formulation for nonlinear systems (referred to as nonlinear model predictive control or NMPC \cite{allgower2012nonlinear}).
NMPC requires solving an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints and (potentially) nonlinear cost function.
As a result algorithms to solve such problems typically require initialization and can struggle to find globally optimal solutions \cite{polak2012optimization}.
Though techniques have been proposed to improve the speed of algorithms to solve NMPC problems \cite{patterson2014gpops,hereid2017frost} or even globally solve such problems without requiring initialization \cite{zhao2017control}, these formulations still take several seconds per iteration, which makes them too slow to be applied during real-time control.
