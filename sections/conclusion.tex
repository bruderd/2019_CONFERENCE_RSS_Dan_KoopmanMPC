\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Discussion of results:
The model predictive controller using the the Koopman model outperformed the other controllers in a variety of trajectory following tasks.

Sources of Error:
-Model inaccuracies due to insufficient data.
-Model inaccuracies due to Koopman truncation.
-Poor performance of electronic pressure regulators.
-Limited accuracy of camera based laser tracking system.

Current Shortcomings of Method:
-Curse of dimensionality, but sparsity could help (cite that paper)
-Does not generalize outside of observed data, could be solved by switching controllers/hybrid models.

Take Aways:
-Has potential to revolutionize soft robot control by providing much more control friendly representation of dynamics.
-Soft robots are well suited for a data-driven method because they can be observed safely under randomized control inputs.
-This is the first time this method has been shown to be effective for controlling a real soft robotic system.
