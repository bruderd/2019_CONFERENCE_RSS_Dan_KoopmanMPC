%% Why soft robots are useful? (is this needed?)
%% Robots are hard to control
Controlling soft robots with precision is a challenge due in large part to the difficulty of constructing models that are amenable to model-based control design techniques.
% %% Soft robots are well-suited for data-driven methods
% Data-driven modeling methods can be used to address this challenge, since soft robots can safely operate under randomized control inputs and are therefor well suited for

%% Koopman operator their offers a solution
Koopman Operator Theory offers a way to construct explicit \emph{linear} dynamical models of soft robots and to control them using established model-based linear control methods.
% by \emph{lifting} state measurements into a higher-dimensional space of real-valued functions and identifying an operator that describes the flow of the system in that space
This method is data-driven, yet unlike other data-driven models such as neural networks, it yields an explicit control-oriented linear model rather than just a ``black-box'' input-output mapping.
%% Summary of contributions
This work describes this Koopman-based system identification method and its application to model predictive controller design.
%% Experiment and results
A model and MPC controller of a pneumatic soft robot arm was constructed via the method, and its performance was evaluated over several trajectory following tasks in the real-world. 
On all of the tasks, the Koopman-based MPC controller outperformed a benchmark MPC controller based on a linear state-space model of the same system.
