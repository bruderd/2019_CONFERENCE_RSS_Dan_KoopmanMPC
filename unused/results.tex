The performances of the K-MPC and L-MPC controllers at Tasks 1 and 2 is shown visually in Fig. \ref{fig:compare_blockM} and \ref{fig:compare_pacman}, and the error is quantified in Table \ref{tab:RMSE}.
In both tasks the K-MPC controller performed best, exhibiting an average tracking error of --- cm which is --- cm lower than that of the L-MPC controller.
